    description: `Ten years ago, I embarked on a life-changing journey that brought me from my hometown in South Korea to the vibrant and culturally diverse United Kingdom. During my time here, I discovered my love for dancing, often spending up to four hours a day immersed in its rhythm and energy.
    My educational journey led me to Wales for high school, where I had the opportunity to experience the rich and welcoming Welsh culture. Following this, I pursued a degree in Aviation Management at Coventry University. However, my passion for coding soon took center stage in my life. I made the bold decision to pivot from aviation management to coding, and here I am today, driven by the aspiration to become a software engineer in the tech industry.
    My journey is a testament to the power of following one's passion and embracing change. Join me on this exciting adventure as I explore the world of technology and share my experiences on the path to becoming a software engineer.`,

    description: `K-pop has been my favorite genre of music since I was just seven years old. It all began with the iconic song 'Into the New World' by Girls' Generation, and I was instantly hooked. From that moment, I embarked on a musical journey filled with the captivating beats and melodies of K-pop.

    Over the years, I've enjoyed a wide range of K-pop artists, from classics like Wonder Girls, Super Junior, and Sistar to more contemporary sensations. These timeless songs still hold a special place in my heart, evoking nostalgia and fond memories.
    
    In the current K-pop scene, I'm captivated by the charisma of Blackpink and the innovative sounds of newcomers like New Jeans. Their music is a delightful blend of artistry and entertainment that I can't help but recommend to anyone seeking musical inspiration. If you haven't already, you absolutely need to give them a listen!`,

    description: `My fashion sense draws a lot of inspiration from Korean styles, particularly favoring innocent and charming looks. I find a certain allure in the elegance of Korean fashion, often opting for long skirts paired with cute tops. This style resonates with me in day-to-day life.

    However, when it's time to step out for parties and special occasions, I love to switch things up. You'll often find me in dresses that exude a more glamorous and elegant vibe. It's all about embracing the diversity of fashion and expressing my personality through different styles, from cute and innocent to chic and sophisticated.`,

    description: `Dance has always held a special place in my heart, and it's a passion I've nurtured for years. On an average day, I can lose myself in dance for up to four hours, and when I'm in the zone, I've even danced for a whopping eight hours straight. It's a testament to how much joy movement brings to my life.

      However, a new love has entered the scene: coding. Ever since I embarked on my coding journey, it's become more than just a hobby; it's become a second passion. During my coding bootcamp, I found myself immersed in code for up to ten hours a day. It might sound crazy to some, but when you're genuinely passionate about something, it doesn't feel like work; it feels like a rewarding adventure. Whether I'm dancing or coding, these two passions have added vibrancy and fulfillment to my life.`,

    description: `Korean cuisine holds a special place in my heart, and it's my all-time favorite food. I simply can't imagine life without the mouthwatering flavors of dishes like tteokbokki, Korean barbecue, sushi (which we affectionately call kimbap), and the spicy tang of kimchi. The rich and diverse world of Korean noodles never fails to delight my taste buds. And let's not forget the comforting presence of rice, a staple I can't live without.

      In addition to Korean delights, Vietnamese cuisine has also found its way into my heart. A steaming bowl of pho has a unique ability to relax and soothe, making it a go-to choice when I'm seeking comfort in a meal. These culinary experiences are more than just sustenance; they're a source of joy and connection to cultures that have enriched my life in delicious ways`,

    description: `My journey into the world of technology began with a fascination for problem-solving. I started by immersing myself in JavaScript challenges, where I discovered the joy of unraveling complex puzzles.

      This newfound passion led me to Code First Girls, an organization where I embarked on a comprehensive learning path. I delved into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and alongside a dynamic team of four, we built a website that not only showcased our skills but also clinched the 'Best Group Project' awardâ€”a defining moment in my tech journey.
      
      Eager to deepen my knowledge, I took the leap into a rigorous 12-week bootcamp. There, I absorbed full-stack technologies like a sponge. The experience was transformative, not just in terms of the skills acquired but also the lifelong friendships forged. In this vibrant and collaborative tech community, I found my true calling, and I'm excited to continue exploring, creating, and contributing to the ever-evolving world of technology.`,
