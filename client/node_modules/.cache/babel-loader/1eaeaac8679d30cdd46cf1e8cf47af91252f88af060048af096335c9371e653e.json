At first, i was scared and worried as i had to leave my friends behind. Furthermore, i had to give up my dream of being a kpop idol as i would have less opportunities if i lived in U.K. Nevertheless, after being here for 10 years now, i am happy that i moved here because the lifestyle seems a lot better and i have built up a lot of confidence.
